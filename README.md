# blog-admin

This is the admin interface for a blog that requires authentication to edit and write posts. It consumes an API I built for creating and sharing posts.

Refer to [blog-api](https://github.com/ken-ux/blog-api) for the backend and [blog-frontend](https://github.com/ken-ux/blog-frontend) for the public interface.
